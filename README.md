# Seiyuu Star Power

Skills used:
React, Golang (Go), Docker, Google Cloud Platform

This is a web application that allows users to search and compare different anime titles and compare the star power of each based on the popularity of their voice actresses/actors (Seiyuu in Japanese).

This project consists of:
A web frontend created using React.
A Golang backend that pulls data from MyAnimeList via the Jikan API.


This is my first foray into these 4 technologies so I'm taking this as more of a learning experience and learning better practices as the project continues to evolve.

How to use this application:

Build and run the containers with `docker-compose` üê≥:

```bash
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose up -d
```

Navigate to localhost:3000 and begin comparing anime titles.

Jikan API:
