# SeiyuuStarPower

Skills used:
Golang (Go), React

This is a web application that allows users to search and compare different anime titles and compare the star power of each based on the popularity of their voice actresses/actors (Seiyuu in Japanese).

This project consists of:
A Golang backend that pulls data from MyAnimeList via the Jikan API
A React frontend that grabs data from the Golang backend.

Once these 2 components are completed, I will be containerizing these components using Docker and running them using Kubernetes so it can be accessible to the public.

This is my first foray into these 4 technologies so I'm taking this as more of a learning experience and learning better practices as the project continues to evolve.
